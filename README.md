# This repository is created by Mehmet Fatih Aktekin and contains the Python codes for the work "Fabrication and Gain Prediction of a Gain Adjustable Preamplifier for Hearing Aids Using Optimization Algorithms."
# The "dataset" file contains the resistance values and the corresponding voltage gains. 
# The "hyperbolic_model" and "polynomial_model" files are the two optimization models mentioned in the work and should be used with "dataset."
# The "theoretical_curve" file is for the graph of the theoretical relationship mentioned in the work and should be used with "dataset."
